# My NixOs Config

Here to show other people how I over engineer things c:

You can look, probably don't use this, it might sporadically break

> [!Important]
> Although I am trying to make this config work on `nixos-23.05` it currently
> only works on `nixos-unstable` (at least the images built with
> nixos-generators). Your mielage may vary.

> [!Note]
> You can find examples using this configuration at my repo:
> [nixos-config-examples](https://github.com/jalil-salame/nixos-config-examples)
